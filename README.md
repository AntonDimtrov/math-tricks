## Description
The game is set on a dynamically generated grid-based board where players take turns moving their tokens (P1 and P2) and accumulating points based on arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) on the visited cells. The objective is to achieve the highest score while navigating the board.

## How to Play
1. At the start of the game, players are placed at opposite corners of the board:
   - Player 1 (P1): Top-left corner.
   - Player 2 (P2): Bottom-right corner.
2. Each player takes turns moving to an adjacent or diagonal cell.
3. The player's score is updated based on the operation (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) and value on the visited cell.
4. The game ends when a player has no valid moves left.

## Features
- **Dynamic Board Generation**: The board is created with arithmetic operations and values, distributed based on distance from the center.
- **Player Scoring**: Each move affects the playerâ€™s score based on the operation and value of the visited cell.
- **Turn-Based Play**: Players alternate turns, with the current player highlighted on the board.
- **Save/Load Functionality**: The game state can be saved and resumed from a file.
- **Real-Time Display**: The board is visually updated after every move.
- **Validation**: Prevents invalid moves and ensures game integrity.
